## 🧠 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts

This project was built using **OOP principles** to ensure modularity, scalability, and maintainability.

| Concept | Description | Example in Project |
|----------|--------------|--------------------|
| **Encapsulation** | Private data accessed through getter/setter methods. | `Customer`, `Restaurant`, and `Order` classes |
| **Inheritance** | Common attributes inherited by specialized classes. | `Client` superclass extended by `Customer` and `Restaurant` |
| **Polymorphism** | Multiple implementations of a single interface. | `displayInfo()` method in different classes |
| **Abstraction** | Hides complex logic for easier use. | Separate handler classes for registration and ordering |
| **Comparator Usage** | Custom sorting logic for clients. | Sorting customers or restaurants alphabetically |

| 🏠 **Home Page** | Main navigation (Register, Add Order, Search, Exit) |
| 👤 **Customer Registration** | Register, edit, display, and delete customers |
| 🍴 **Restaurant Registration** | Register, edit, display, and delete restaurants |
| 🧾 **Order Page** | Add new orders and calculate totals |
| 🔎 **Search Page** | Find customer/restaurant information |

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have installed:

✅ **[JDK (Java Development Kit)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk17-downloads.html)**  
✅ **[MySQL Connector/J](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/)** – for database connectivity  
✅ **[JCalendar Library](https://toedter.com/jcalendar/)** – for date selection in the UI

## 🗂️ About `.form` Files (Important)

Each GUI `.java` file (e.g., `CustomerForm.java`) has a matching `.form` file (e.g., `CustomerForm.form`).  
The `.form` files are **auto-generated by NetBeans GUI Builder (Matisse)** and store the **layout design** of the interface.

| File Type | Purpose |
|------------|----------|
| `.java` | Contains source code and event handling |
| `.form` | Stores UI layout for the NetBeans GUI editor |

> ⚠️ **Do not delete `.form` files.**  
> They are needed to open and edit the GUI visually in NetBeans.  
> The program can still run without them, but you’ll lose the drag-and-drop design view.
